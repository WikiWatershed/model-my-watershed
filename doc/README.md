## Python Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the use of the Model My Watershed geoprocessing API

The following Jupyter Notebooks provide example workflows for the Model My Watershed (ModelMW) public web services Application Programming Interface (API) for automating some of the workflows that are provided by the web application.

Detailed ModelMW web service API documentation is provided at: https://modelmywatershed.org/api/docs/

Example notebooks were first created by [Emilio Mayorga](https://github.com/emiliom/) (University of Washington) on 2018-8-19, and have been maintained to work with subsequent changes to the API.

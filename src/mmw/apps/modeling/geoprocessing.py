    Run a geoprocessing operation.

    Given an operation name and a dictionary of input data, looks up the
    operation from the list of supported operations in settings.GEOP['json'],
    combines it with input data, and submits it to the Geoprocessing Service.

    All errors are passed along and not raised here, so that error handling can
    be attached to the final task in the chain, without needing to be attached
    to every task.

    If a well-known area of interest id is specified in wkaoi, checks to see
    if there is a cached result for that wkaoi and operation. If so, returns
    that immediately. If not, starts the geoprocessing operation, and saves the
    results to they key before passing them on.

    When using a parameterizable operation, such as 'ppt' or 'tmean', a special
    cache_key can be provided which will be used for caching instead of the
    opname, which in this case is not unique to the operation.

    Perform a multi-operation geoprocessing request.

    Given an operation name, a list of shapes, and a string of MultiLine
    GeoJSON, where each item in 'shapes' is like:

        { 'id': '', shape: '' }

    where 'shape' is a stringified GeoJSON of a Polygon or MultiPolygon and
    'stream_lines' is a stringified GeoJSON of a MultiLine, combines it with
    the JSON saved in settings.GEOP.json corresponding to the opname, to make
    a payload like this:

        {
            'shapes': [],
            'streamLines': '',
            'operations': []

            'name': '',

            'rasters': [],
            'targetRaster': '',
            'pixelIsArea': false
        }

    where 'rasters' is an array of strings, and 'targetRaster' and
    'pixelIsArea' are optional.

    Error handling behaves identically to `run` above, i.e. any errors are
    caught and passed along as 'error' keys so they may be handled in a task
    further down the Celery chain.

    If there is an operation with 'name' == 'RasterLinesJoin', 'streamLines'
    should not be empty. If it is empty, that operation will be skipped.

    The results will be in the format:

        {
            '{{ shape_id }}': {
                '{{ operation_label }}': {{ operation_results }},
                '{{ operation_label }}': {{ operation_results }},

            ...
        }

    where `shape_id` is for each shape, and `operation_label` is for each
    operation. The `operation_results` are a dictionary with string keys and
    double values. The keys need to be parsed with the `parse` method below.

    Each `operation_results` is cached with the key:

        {{ shape_id }}__{{ operation_label }}

    Before running the geoprocessing service, we inspect the cache to see
    if all the requested operations are already cached for this shape. If so,
    we remove that shape from the payload.

    If not found in the cache, the specified operations are run for that shape
    as part of the payload. Once we have the results back, we cache them. Since
    we are using the same cache naming scheme as run, any operation cached via
    `multi` can be reused by `run`.

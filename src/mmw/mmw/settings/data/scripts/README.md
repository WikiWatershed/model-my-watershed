### DRB
---------
The file `drb_perimeter.json` was generated by opening the shapefile in
smb://fileshare/projects/Stroud_ModelMyWatershed/data/drb_bnd_polygon.zip in
QGIS, and then saving as GeoJSON, making sure to set the CRS to EPSG:4326 (which
is not done by default). In order to add a buffer to `drb_perimeter.json`, run
`npm install` and then `./bufferDRB.js`. To further simplify it, feed the
generated file into [Mapshaper](http://www.mapshaper.org). The output will have
to be modified slightly to put it into the same format as
`drb_simple_perimeter.json`. To test the validity of the GeoJSON, use
[GeoJSONLint](http://geojsonlint.com/). The original and simplified polygons can
be easily compared using QGIS.

### DRWI
---------
The `drwi_perimeter.json` was generated with the following query in PostGIS:

```sql
SELECT ST_AsGeoJSON(ST_Union(geom))
FROM boundary_huc08
WHERE huc08 LIKE '0204%'
  AND huc08 NOT IN ('02040303', '02040304');
```

This was then buffered with `scripts/bufferDRWI.js`, and then simplified using
[Mapshaper](http://www.mapshaper.org) to 2.2%, which is about the same as was
done for `drb_simple_perimeter`. The file was then manually edited to remove
the `GeometryCollection` parent, keeping only the `Polygon` value.

Finally, this was Unioned and Dissolved with the `drb_simple_perimeter` in QGIS
to ensure that no DRB parts were missed.

### PA
---------

The `pa_perimeter.json` was updated in [e40594cc](https://github.com/WikiWatershed/model-my-watershed/commit/e40594cc719ce57b0f4e6178ebe2ed6a7472146e), first by downloading the latest available Pennsylvania State Boundary geojson file from [PennDOT GIS PennShare](https://data-pennshare.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/PennShare::pennsylvania-state-boundary/about) and then simplifying using
[Mapshaper](http://www.mapshaper.org) to 0.8% after visually verifying this percentage simplification was the lowest value that still captured the entirety of PA perimeter. File was then manually updated to match previous format.

The `pa_simple_perimeter.json` file was created following by the conventions set in perimeters above. The newly created `pa_perimeter.json` file was buffered with `scripts/bufferPA.js` and simplified again using
[Mapshaper](http://www.mapshaper.org) to 6.2%. The file was then manually edited to remove
the `GeometryCollection` parent. The buffer and simplification values were updated for this file after manually verifying the lowest buffer and simplification that still captured the perimeter.

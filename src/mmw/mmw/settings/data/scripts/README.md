The file `drb_perimeter.json` was generated by opening the shapefile in
smb://fileshare/projects/Stroud_ModelMyWatershed/data/drb_bnd_polygon.zip in
QGIS, and then saving as GeoJSON, making sure to set the CRS to EPSG:4326 (which
is not done by default). In order to add a buffer to `drb_perimeter.json`, run
`npm install` and then `./bufferDRB.js`. To further simplify it, feed the
generated file into [Mapshaper](http://www.mapshaper.org). The output will have
to be modified slightly to put it into the same format as
`drb_simple_perimeter.json`. To test the validity of the GeoJSON, use
[GeoJSONLint](http://geojsonlint.com/). The original and simplified polygons can
be easily compared using QGIS.

The `drwi_perimeter.json` was generated with the following query in PostGIS:

```sql
SELECT ST_AsGeoJSON(ST_Union(geom))
FROM boundary_huc08
WHERE huc08 LIKE '0204%'
  AND huc08 NOT IN ('02040303', '02040304');
```

This was then buffered with `scripts/bufferDRWI.js`, and then simplified using
[Mapshaper](http://www.mapshaper.org) to 2.2%, which is about the same as was
done for `drb_simple_perimeter`. The file was then manually edited to remove
the `GeometryCollection` parent, keeping only the `Polygon` value.

Finally, this was Unioned and Dissolved with the `drb_simple_perimeter` in QGIS
to ensure that no DRB parts were missed.
